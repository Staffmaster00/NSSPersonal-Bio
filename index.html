			<p>
			Recently I've been working with Michael Connors, a local musician, to write songs and children's books. 

			Michael started a scholarship charity called Kids that Rock which focused on providing a way for high school kids to earn a scholarship through music with community support. I assisted the launch show and we were able to provide a $500 dollar scholarship!
